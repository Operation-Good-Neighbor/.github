# Welcome to the Neighborhood!
Operation: Good-Neighbor is an open-sourced, four-step program that intends to unofficially offer, extend, and integrate technical services to Madison,
North Carolina as they potentially expand into a larger-scale tourist destination.

Essentially; we collectivise ourselves as an open-air mall complete with anchor stores selling locally produced arts, crafts, and _spirits_ but also
offering pop-up kiosks open to vendors from all over; along with live music and street performers.  And to top it all off we not only embrace the recent
popularity of 28 Days Haunted, but extend that to rebranding the Civil War Battlefield as a __*Haunted*__ Civil War Battlefield and playing along with the
idea of putting the town on the map as a living occultic tourist destination in much the same way Salem does with their tragic history.

But not only just, we have plenty to offer those of a more grounded persuasion; there's the hobby shop; there's the Dan River access.

If this were to come to pass, then some certain critical points of infrastructure would need to be improved upon to better facilitate the experience of being in this town; better capacity for a sudden influx of people.
